quiz app using java(mini project)

The Quiz Console App is a simple Java-based application presenting users with multiple-choice questions. It uses OOP principles, loops, arrays, and user input handling to create an interactive quiz experience. Users select answers, receive feedback, and see their final score. The app ensures input validation and displays the correct answers for incorrect choices. Future enhancements may include a timer, difficulty levels, and question categories.
